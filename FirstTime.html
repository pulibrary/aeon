                <h2>First Time User Registration for Aeon</h2>

                <div>To request an item, you must first identify yourself to the library's Aeon system. To do this you fill out a registration form using your Web browser.</div>
                <div>Registration has three purposes:</div>

                <ul>
                    <li>Entering your personal information into the Aeon system means you will not have to supply the information
                        again when making future requests.</li>
                    <li>Having your email and regular mail addresses on file with Special Collections enables us to notify you
                        promptly and deliver materials accurately.</li>
                    <li>By specifying a Username and Password of your choosing, you will have secure access to information about
                        your requests. You will also be able to review the list of items you have requested in the past.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-block">
                <h2>About your Username and Password</h2>
                <div>
                    During registration, you will be asked to choose a Username and Password. You will use this Username and Password when logging
                    on to the Aeon system in the future.
                </div>

                <div>
                    <strong>Username</strong>
                    <div>Choose anything you like, such as your name, abbreviations, or an alphanumeric code.</div>

                    <strong>Password</strong>
                    <div>Choose anything you like. We recommend that you follow good security practice and choose a password that is different from those you use to access other systems.</div>
                    <div>Aeon will encrypt your password, so it will remain secure. Only you will know your password.</div>

                <h2>Important Copyright Information</h2>
                <div>WARNING CONCERNING COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS</div>
                <div>The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) governs the making of photocopies or
                        other reproductions of copyrighted materials.
                </div>
                <div>Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy
                        or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not
                        to be &quot;used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research&quot;. If a user
                        makes a request for, or later uses, a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of &quot;fair
                        use&quot;, that user may be liable for copyright infringement.
                </div>
                <div>This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment
                        of the order would involve violation of copyright law.
