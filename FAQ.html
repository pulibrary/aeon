                <h2>What is Aeon?</h2>

                <p>
                    Aeon is the electronic system you use to request an item through Special Collections as well as track the history
                    of requests you've received previously.
                </p>

                <a name="userid"></a>
                <h2>Why do I need a username and password to use Aeon?</h2>

                <p>
                    Your username and password allows us to give you secure access to information about your requests. We can also enable
                    you to edit your personal information such as your address or phone number.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your username can be anything you like, such as your name, abbreviations, or an alphanumeric code. Your password
                    also can be anything you like. We recommend that you follow good security practice and choose a password that
                    is different from those you use to access other systems. However, no one but you will know your password, not
                    even the special collections staff. The password you set is stored encrypted.
                </p>

                <a name="password"></a>
                <h2>What if I forget my password?</h2>

                <p>
                    In the event that you forget your password, please contact the Special Collections office at (800) 555-1212. We can
                    then reset your password allowing you access to Aeon. Please change your password once you logon to Aeon.
                </p>

                <a name="webbrowser"></a>

                <h2>What Web browser should I use?</h2>

                <p>
                    You need a Web browser that can handle forms, tables, and preferably cascading style sheets (CSS). We recommend the
                    current versions of either Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox.
                </p>

                <a name="security"></a>

                <h2>Is security a problem if I use a public workstation?</h2>

                <p>
                    Yes. Web browsers cache information and create a history file on the local workstation. This allows a subsequent
                    user of the workstation to access the system under your name using the browser's Back button to recall a page
                    from the cache, or by finding a page with your personal information in the browser's history file. If you are
                    concerned about the security of your requests, you can take the following steps:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Access Aeon only from your personal computer or an otherwise secure workstation.</li>
                    <li>
                        Access Aeon from a public workstation in the Special Collections office. These computers are supervised by the
                        staff.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When using a public access workstation:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Delete from the history file those pages that contain your personal information.</li>
                            <li>
                                Exit from the Web browser before you leave the workstation. This prevents the Back button from accessing
                                the pages you were using.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The technology that we use sends a Session ID to be stored on your machine. You can refuse this cookie and still
                    be able to use Aeon without any problems.
